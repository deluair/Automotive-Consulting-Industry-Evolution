## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deluair/Automotive-Consulting-Industry-Evolution.git
   cd Automotive-Consulting-Industry-Evolution
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   Or with pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Simulations

#### Chinese Manufacturer Expansion Simulation

Simulate the global expansion of Chinese automakers and their impact on the automotive industry:

```python
from src.models.industry_reconfiguration.chinese_manufacturer_expansion import run_chinese_expansion_simulation

# Run simulation from 2025 to 2040
results = run_chinese_expansion_simulation(
    start_year=2025,
    end_year=2040,
    regions=['CHINA', 'EUROPE', 'NORTH_AMERICA'],
    segments=['EV', 'MASS_MARKET', 'PREMIUM']
)
```

### Generating Visualizations

Create interactive visualizations of simulation results:

```python
from src.visualization.dashboard import create_market_overview

# Generate an interactive market overview dashboard
fig = create_market_overview(
    market_data=results,
    title="Automotive Market Overview (2025-2040)"
)
fig.show()  # Display in Jupyter notebook
fig.write_html("reports/dashboards/market_overview.html")  # Save as HTML
```

### Generating Reports

Create comprehensive HTML reports with visualizations and analysis:

```python
from src.visualization.report_generator import ReportGenerator

# Initialize report generator
report = ReportGenerator(title="Automotive Industry Evolution: 2025-2040")

# Add sections, figures, and tables
report.add_section("Executive Summary", "...")
report.add_figure(fig, "Market Overview")

# Save and open the report
report.save_report("automotive_analysis_report.html")
report.open_in_browser()
```
